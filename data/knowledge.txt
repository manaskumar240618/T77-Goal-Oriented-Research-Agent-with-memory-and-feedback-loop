Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously pursue goals. 
These agents are not just reactive; they can plan, reason, and adapt their strategies.
A key component of an agentic system is its ability to use tools and memory.
The memory allows the agent to learn from past interactions and feedback.
A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model is a common way to provide memory,
allowing the agent to pull in relevant facts from a knowledge base.
The feedback loop is crucial for improvement, letting the agent know
if its actions were successful or not.
